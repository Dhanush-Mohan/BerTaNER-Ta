# BerTaNER-Ta
BerTaNER is an advanced machine learning project focused on improving Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Tamil, a morphologically rich and low-resource language. The project fine-tunes two transformer-based models, TamilBERT and Multilingual BERT (mBERT), leveraging token classification to enhance entity recognition accuracy.
